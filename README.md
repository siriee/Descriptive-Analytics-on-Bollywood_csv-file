#**Descriptive Analytics**


Descriptive analytics is the initial phase of data analysis that focuses on summarizing, organizing, and presenting data to gain insights into past or current events. It involves the following key aspects:
**
Data Summarization**: Descriptive analytics involves techniques for summarizing and condensing data, such as calculating mean, median, mode, and various measures of spread (e.g., variance and standard deviation) to provide an overview of the data's central tendencies and variability.

**Data Visualization**: It includes creating graphical representations of data, like bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and box plots, to visually convey patterns, trends, and distributions within the data.

**Frequency Distributions**: Descriptive analytics helps in creating frequency distributions and tables to display how data is distributed across different categories or intervals, which can be particularly useful for categorical data or discrete numeric data.
